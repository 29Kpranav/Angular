input.ng-invalid{
  border: 1px solid red;
}

/*
In Angular, when using forms and form validation, the ng-invalid class is dynamically added to form controls that have failed 
validation based on defined validation rules. For instance, if an input is required but left empty, or if the input doesn't match
 a specified pattern, the ng-invalid class will be applied to indicate that the input is invalid.

By defining styles for input.ng-invalid, you're customizing how these invalid inputs will visually appear on the webpage, in this
 case, by giving them a red border. This styling can serve as a visual cue to users that there's an issue with the input that 
 needs attention
